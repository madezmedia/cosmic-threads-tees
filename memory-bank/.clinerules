# Cosmic Threads Project Intelligence

This file captures important patterns, preferences, and project intelligence for the Cosmic Threads T-shirt design application. It will be updated as new patterns are discovered and validated.

## Project Structure Patterns

### File Organization

- **Page Components**: Located in `/app` directory following Next.js App Router convention
- **Reusable Components**: Located in `/components` directory
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui components in `/components/ui` directory
- **Custom Hooks**: Located in `/hooks` directory
- **Utility Functions**: Located in `/lib` directory
- **API Routes**: Located in `/app/api` directory
- **Types**: Located in `/types` directory

### Naming Conventions

- **Components**: PascalCase (e.g., `DesignGenerator.tsx`)
- **Hooks**: camelCase with 'use' prefix (e.g., `useImageGeneration.ts`)
- **Utility Functions**: camelCase (e.g., `formatCurrency.ts`)
- **API Routes**: kebab-case for directories, `route.ts` for files
- **Context Providers**: PascalCase with 'Provider' suffix (e.g., `CartProvider.tsx`)

## Code Style Preferences

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new files
- Define explicit types for function parameters and return values
- Use interfaces for complex object types
- Use type guards for runtime type checking

### React Components

- Prefer functional components with hooks over class components
- Use destructuring for props
- Define prop types with TypeScript interfaces
- Use React.FC type sparingly (prefer explicit return types)

### CSS/Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling
- Follow the project's retro-futuristic aesthetic
- Use CSS variables for theme colors and spacing
- Maintain responsive design for all components

### Retro-Futuristic Design System

- **Color Palette**:
  - `deepSpace`: Dark background color (#0a0a1a)

  - `silverChrome`: Text and border color (#c0c0c0)

- **Typography**:
  - Use `font-mono` for UI elements, labels, and technical text
  - Use `font-display` for headings and titles
  - Use `font-sans` for body text and content
  - Apply uppercase and tracking-wider to mono font elements

- **UI Component Variants**:
  - `cosmic`: Purple-based primary variant
  - `neon`: Teal-based secondary variant
  - `chrome`: Silver/metallic neutral variant
  - `gradient`: Gradient effect for emphasis
  - `glass`: Translucent background effect

- **Effects**:
  - Use subtle glow effects with box-shadow

- Provide detailed logging and reporting
- Implement error handling that continues processing after failures
- Use TypeScript for type safety in request/response handling

## Known Quirks and Workarounds

### Next.js Theme Hydration Issues

- **Issue**: Next.js applications with theme switching (especially dark mode) can experience hydration mismatches between server and client rendering.
- **Symptoms**: Console errors about hydration mismatches, specifically related to the HTML element's class or style attributes.
- **Workaround**: Add the `suppressHydrationWarning` attribute to the HTML element in the root layout:
  ```tsx
  <html lang="en" suppressHydrationWarning>
    {/* ... */}
  </html>
  ```
- **Explanation**: This tells React to ignore hydration mismatches for the HTML element, which is a recommended solution for theme-related hydration issues.
- **Alternative Solutions**:
  1. Use a client-only component for theme switching
  2. Implement a "flash of incorrect theme" prevention technique
  3. Use CSS variables instead of classes for theming

### Component Context Dependencies

- **Issue**: Some components require specific context providers to function correctly.
- **Example**: The `StyleSelector` component requires the `DesignContext` provider, while the `StyleGuideSelector` component accepts props directly.
- **Pattern**: 
  - Context-dependent components: Used within specific provider wrappers (e.g., `StyleSelector` within `DesignProvider`)
  - Standalone components: Accept props directly without context dependencies (e.g., `StyleGuideSelector`)
- **Best Practice**: 
  - Document context dependencies in component comments
  - Use context-dependent components only within appropriate providers
  - Consider creating standalone versions of components for flexibility
  - When duplicating functionality, prefer props-based components for better reusability
- **Identification**: Components using hooks like `useDesign()` require their respective context providers

## Project-Specific Terminology

- **Design**: A user-created t-shirt design
- **Prompt**: Text description used to generate a design
- **Enhanced Prompt**: AI-improved version of user prompt
- **Style**: Visual aesthetic applied to generated designs
- **Mockup**: Visualization of design on a t-shirt
- **Placement**: Location of design on a product (front, back, sleeve)
- **Batch Generation**: Process of generating multiple designs at once
- **Gallery**: Interface for browsing and filtering generated designs
- **Medium**: Product type (t-shirt, wall art, etc.)
- **Metadata**: Additional information stored with a design (style, tags, etc.)
