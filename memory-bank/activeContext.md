# Active Context: Cosmic Threads

## Current Work Focus

The project is currently in the **initial setup and development phase**. We are establishing the memory bank documentation system to ensure clear understanding and continuity throughout the development process. This documentation will serve as the foundation for all future work on the Cosmic Threads platform.

### Primary Focus Areas

1. **Memory Bank Initialization**
   - Creating comprehensive documentation of project requirements, architecture, and technical context
   - Establishing patterns for maintaining and updating documentation

2. **Project Structure Analysis**
   - Understanding the existing Next.js application structure
   - Identifying key components and their relationships
   - Mapping API routes and their functionality

3. **Core Functionality Assessment**
   - Evaluating the implementation status of key features
   - Identifying gaps in current functionality
   - Prioritizing development tasks

4. **Printful API v2 Integration**
   - Implementing API routes for the Printful API v2 beta
   - Adding caching middleware for improved performance
   - Creating a demo page for testing the integration

## Recent Changes

### Printful API v2 Caching Implementation (March 18, 2025)

Implemented a comprehensive caching system for the Printful API v2 integration:

1. **API Route Caching Middleware**: Created a reusable middleware (`middleware/api-cache.ts`) that provides caching for all API routes, with detailed logging for cache hits and misses.

2. **Enhanced API Response Handling**: Updated the Printful API v2 service to handle different response structures from the API, improving reliability.

3. **Performance Monitoring**: Added console.time/timeEnd calls to track API call performance and identify bottlenecks.

4. **Documentation**: Updated the Printful API v2 documentation to reflect the new caching system and provide usage examples.

5. **Applied Caching to All Routes**: Implemented caching for all Printful API v2 routes, including catalog products, variants, mockup styles, and utility endpoints.

### Theme Hydration Fix (March 18, 2025)

Fixed a React hydration mismatch error related to the theme implementation:

1. **Issue Identified**: The server was rendering the HTML element with dark theme classes, but the client was initializing differently, causing a hydration mismatch error.

2. **Solution Implemented**: Added the `suppressHydrationWarning` attribute to the HTML element in `app/layout.tsx` to tell React to ignore hydration mismatches for the HTML element.

3. **Result**: The development server now runs without hydration errors, and the theme is applied consistently.

4. **Knowledge Gained**: This is a common issue with Next.js applications that use theming, particularly with dark mode. The `suppressHydrationWarning` attribute is a recommended solution for theme-related hydration issues.

### Supabase MCP Server Setup (March 17, 2025)

The Supabase MCP server has been set up to enable direct database interaction from Cline and other MCP-compatible AI assistants. This enhancement provides several benefits:

1. **Direct Database Access**: AI assistants can now directly query the Supabase database, explore schema, and execute SQL operations with appropriate safety controls.

2. **Database Schema Exploration**: The server enables exploration of database tables, columns, and relationships, providing better visibility into the data structure.

3. **Sample Data Creation**: Initial sample data has been created in the database:
   - User record linked to auth.users
   - Project record for "Cosmic Threads Demo"
   - Design record for "Cosmic Nebula Tee"
   - Sample order record

4. **Enhanced Development Workflow**: Developers and AI assistants can now collaborate more effectively on database-related tasks, with appropriate safety controls in place.

## Next Steps

Based on the current progress, the following next steps have been identified:

1. **Complete Printful API v2 Integration**
   - Update the demo page to properly display product information
   - Add error handling and retry logic for API calls
   - Implement the remaining API endpoints (order creation, etc.)
   - Add unit tests for the API service and middleware

2. **Integrate Printful API with T-Shirt Customization**
   - Connect the Printful API to the t-shirt customization UI
   - Implement color and size selection based on available variants
   - Create realistic mockup generation using the Printful API

3. **Develop Core AI Design Generation**
   - Implement or enhance the prompt-to-design generation flow
   - Connect fal.ai API for image generation
   - Create user-friendly interface for design creation

4. **Implement E-commerce Functionality**
   - Complete cart and checkout flow
   - Integrate with Printful for fulfillment
   - Set up payment processing with Stripe

5. **Establish User Authentication**
   - Configure Supabase authentication
   - Create user registration and login flows
   - Implement protected routes for user-specific content

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Caching Strategy

**Decision Made**: Implemented a dual-layer caching system for the Printful API v2 integration:
1. Service-level caching in the API service module
2. API route-level caching via middleware

**Considerations**:
- Caching significantly improves performance for slow API calls
- Default TTL of 1 hour balances freshness and performance
- Detailed logging helps identify cache hits and misses
- Future improvement: Replace in-memory caching with Redis for distributed caching

### Design System Approach

**Decision Needed**: Whether to fully adopt shadcn/ui for all components or create custom components for specialized features.

**Considerations**:
- shadcn/ui provides a consistent, accessible component library
- Custom components may be needed for unique features like the design studio
- Hybrid approach may be most effective, using shadcn/ui as a foundation

### AI Generation Strategy

**Decision Needed**: How to optimize the AI generation process for both quality and cost.

**Considerations**:
- fal.ai pricing is based on generation volume
- Generation quality vs. speed tradeoffs
- Caching strategies for similar prompts
- Potential for client-side vs. server-side generation

### Database Schema Refinement

**Decision Needed**: Finalize the database schema for designs, orders, and user profiles.

**Considerations**:
- Efficient storage of design metadata and images
- Relationship between designs and orders
- User preferences and history tracking
- Performance optimization for frequent queries

## Current Challenges

1. **API Response Handling**
   - Handling different response structures from the Printful API
   - Managing rate limits and API errors
   - Optimizing performance for slow API calls

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Minimizing loading times for design generation
   - Efficient rendering of design previews
   - Responsive experience across devices

3. **E-commerce Integration**
   - Seamless flow from design to purchase
   - Accurate pricing and shipping calculations
   - Order tracking and management

4. **User Experience Refinement**
   - Intuitive design creation process
   - Clear feedback during AI generation
   - Simplified checkout process

## Team Coordination

As development progresses, this section will track team responsibilities, communication channels, and coordination strategies. For now, the focus is on establishing the foundation for effective collaboration through comprehensive documentation.
