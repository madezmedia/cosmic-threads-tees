### Package Dependency Pinning (March 19, 2025)

Pinned all package dependencies to specific versions for improved production stability:

1. **Issue Identified**: Many dependencies were set to "latest" in package.json, which can lead to unpredictable builds, harder debugging, and potential security vulnerabilities.

2. **Solution Implemented**: Updated package.json to pin all dependencies to their current specific versions using the caret (^) notation for minor version flexibility.

3. **Key Dependencies Updated**:
   - React 19 and Next.js 15.1.0 (already pinned to specific versions)
   - All "latest" dependencies now pinned to their current versions:
     - @hookform/resolvers: ^4.1.3
     - @radix-ui/react-progress: ^1.1.2
     - @radix-ui/react-separator: ^1.1.2
     - zod: ^3.24.2
     - @emotion/is-prop-valid: ^1.3.1
     - @supabase/supabase-js: ^2.49.1
     - @auth/core: ^0.34.2
     - And several others

4. **Benefits**:
   - More predictable builds and deployments
   - Easier debugging of version-specific issues
   - Improved security by preventing automatic updates to potentially vulnerable versions
   - Better control over the update process

### Optimized User Experience Workflow Implementation (March 19, 2025)

Implemented a comprehensive, streamlined UX workflow for the design creation process:

1. **New Component Architecture**: Created five new components to support the optimized workflow:
   - `MediumSelector`: Visual card-based interface for selecting product type (T-shirts, Wall Art, etc.)
   - `StyleGuideSelector`: Interactive style selection with categories, AI recommendations, and visual previews
   - `EnhancedDesignGenerator`: Advanced design generation with AI prompt enhancement and real-time feedback
   - `ProductCustomizer`: Product-specific options and design placement controls with live preview
   - `WorkflowSteps`: Visual progress indicator showing the user's journey through the workflow

2. **Progressive Disclosure Pattern**: Implemented a step-by-step workflow that reveals options progressively:
   - Step 1: Medium selection (product type)
   - Step 2: Style guide selection (aesthetic direction)
   - Step 3: Design generation (AI-assisted creation)
   - Step 4: Product customization (colors, sizes, placement)

3. **Enhanced User Feedback**: Added multiple feedback mechanisms:
   - Visual progress indicators during generation
   - Real-time updates when changing options
   - Clear visual cues for selected options
   - Contextual help and information

4. **Mobile Optimization**: Ensured responsive layouts for all components with simplified mobile views and touch-friendly interface elements.

5. **Updated Create Page**: Completely refactored the `/create` page to implement the new workflow, replacing the previous implementation with the new component architecture.

### Printful API v2 Caching Implementation (March 18, 2025)

Implemented a comprehensive caching system for the Printful API v2 integration:

1. **API Route Caching Middleware**: Created a reusable middleware (`middleware/api-cache.ts`) that provides caching for all API routes, with detailed logging for cache hits and misses.

2. **Enhanced API Response Handling**: Updated the Printful API v2 service to handle different response structures from the API, improving reliability.

3. **Performance Monitoring**: Added console.time/timeEnd calls to track API call performance and identify bottlenecks.

4. **Documentation**: Updated the Printful API v2 documentation to reflect the new caching system and provide usage examples.

5. **Applied Caching to All Routes**: Implemented caching for all Printful API v2 routes, including catalog products, variants, mockup styles, and utility endpoints.

### Theme Hydration Fix (March 18, 2025)

Fixed a React hydration mismatch error related to the theme implementation:

1. **Issue Identified**: The server was rendering the HTML element with dark theme classes, but the client was initializing differently, causing a hydration mismatch error.

2. **Solution Implemented**: Added the `suppressHydrationWarning` attribute to the HTML element in `app/layout.tsx` to tell React to ignore hydration mismatches for the HTML element.

3. **Result**: The development server now runs without hydration errors, and the theme is applied consistently.

4. **Knowledge Gained**: This is a common issue with Next.js applications that use theming, particularly with dark mode. The `suppressHydrationWarning` attribute is a recommended solution for theme-related hydration issues.

## Recent Updates

### Fixed Duplicated Design Pages (March 20, 2025)

Resolved an issue with duplicated design pages and incorrect component usage:

1. **Issue Identified**: The app had two design pages (`/design` and `/create`) with different implementations:
   - The `/design` page was incorrectly trying to use the `StyleSelector` component which requires the `DesignContext` provider
   - The `/design` page wasn't wrapped in a `DesignProvider`, causing errors

2. **Solution Implemented**:
   - Updated the `/design` page to use the `StyleGuideSelector` component instead, which accepts props directly
   - Added a `handleToggleStyle` function to properly handle style selection
   - Updated the login redirect from `/design` to `/create` to ensure users are redirected to the proper page after login

3. **Result**: Both pages can now coexist without conflicts:
   - The `/create` page uses the context-based approach with the `DesignProvider`
   - The `/design` page uses the props-based approach without requiring context
   - All changes have been deployed to production

## Next Steps
