# Active Context: Cosmic Threads

## Current Work Focus

The project is currently in the **initial setup and development phase**. We are establishing the memory bank documentation system to ensure clear understanding and continuity throughout the development process. This documentation will serve as the foundation for all future work on the Cosmic Threads platform.

### Primary Focus Areas

1. **Memory Bank Initialization**
   - Creating comprehensive documentation of project requirements, architecture, and technical context
   - Establishing patterns for maintaining and updating documentation

2. **Project Structure Analysis**
   - Understanding the existing Next.js application structure
   - Identifying key components and their relationships
   - Mapping API routes and their functionality

3. **Core Functionality Assessment**
   - Evaluating the implementation status of key features
   - Identifying gaps in current functionality
   - Prioritizing development tasks

## Recent Changes

As this is the initial setup of the memory bank, there are no recent changes to report. This section will be updated as development progresses to track significant changes to the codebase, architecture, or requirements.

## Next Steps

Based on the initial assessment of the project, the following next steps have been identified:

1. **Complete Memory Bank Setup**
   - Finalize all core documentation files
   - Create `.clinerules` file to capture project-specific patterns and preferences
   - Ensure all documentation is consistent and comprehensive

2. **Develop Core AI Design Generation**
   - Implement or enhance the prompt-to-design generation flow
   - Connect fal.ai API for image generation
   - Create user-friendly interface for design creation

3. **Implement T-Shirt Customization**
   - Develop t-shirt preview with design placement options
   - Implement color and size selection
   - Create realistic mockup generation

4. **Set Up Printful Integration**
   - Connect Printful API for product catalog
   - Implement order submission process
   - Test end-to-end fulfillment flow

5. **Establish User Authentication**
   - Configure Supabase authentication
   - Create user registration and login flows
   - Implement protected routes for user-specific content

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Design System Approach

**Decision Needed**: Whether to fully adopt shadcn/ui for all components or create custom components for specialized features.

**Considerations**:
- shadcn/ui provides a consistent, accessible component library
- Custom components may be needed for unique features like the design studio
- Hybrid approach may be most effective, using shadcn/ui as a foundation

### AI Generation Strategy

**Decision Needed**: How to optimize the AI generation process for both quality and cost.

**Considerations**:
- fal.ai pricing is based on generation volume
- Generation quality vs. speed tradeoffs
- Caching strategies for similar prompts
- Potential for client-side vs. server-side generation

### Database Schema Refinement

**Decision Needed**: Finalize the database schema for designs, orders, and user profiles.

**Considerations**:
- Efficient storage of design metadata and images
- Relationship between designs and orders
- User preferences and history tracking
- Performance optimization for frequent queries

### Authentication Flow

**Decision Needed**: Determine the authentication flow and user onboarding process.

**Considerations**:
- Frictionless signup process to encourage conversion
- Social login options vs. email/password
- Guest checkout vs. required account creation
- User profile data collection strategy

## Current Challenges

1. **AI Generation Quality**
   - Ensuring consistent, high-quality design outputs
   - Handling edge cases in user prompts
   - Optimizing generation parameters for t-shirt designs

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Minimizing loading times for design generation
   - Efficient rendering of design previews
   - Responsive experience across devices

3. **E-commerce Integration**
   - Seamless flow from design to purchase
   - Accurate pricing and shipping calculations
   - Order tracking and management

4. **User Experience Refinement**
   - Intuitive design creation process
   - Clear feedback during AI generation
   - Simplified checkout process

## Team Coordination

As development progresses, this section will track team responsibilities, communication channels, and coordination strategies. For now, the focus is on establishing the foundation for effective collaboration through comprehensive documentation.
