- stripe_customer_id (text, nullable)

**public.projects**
- id (uuid, primary key)
- name (text, not null)
- description (text, nullable)
- user_id (uuid, not null, foreign key to users.id)
- created_at (timestamp with time zone, not null)
- updated_at (timestamp with time zone, not null)
- is_public (boolean, not null, default: false)
- thumbnail_url (text, nullable)

**public.designs**

## Known Issues

### Resolved Issues

1. **Theme Hydration Mismatch (Resolved on March 18, 2025)**
   - **Issue**: React hydration mismatch error related to the theme implementation. The server was rendering the HTML element with dark theme classes, but the client was initializing differently.
   - **Solution**: Added the `suppressHydrationWarning` attribute to the HTML element in `app/layout.tsx` to tell React to ignore hydration mismatches for the HTML element.
   - **Impact**: The development server now runs without hydration errors, and the theme is applied consistently.
   - **Prevention**: This is a common issue with Next.js applications that use theming, particularly with dark mode. The `suppressHydrationWarning` attribute is a recommended solution for theme-related hydration issues.

### Current Issues

1. **Printful API v2 Demo Page Display (March 18, 2025)**
   - **Issue**: The Printful API v2 demo page is not properly displaying product information from the API.
   - **Status**: Identified issue with API response handling in the `callPrintfulApi` function.
   - **Next Steps**: Update the demo page to properly parse and display the API response.

### Potential Areas to Monitor

1. **AI Generation Quality**
   - Consistency of generated designs
   - Handling of complex or ambiguous prompts
   - Generation speed and reliability

2. **Integration Challenges**
   - Printful API limitations or rate limits
   - Payment processing edge cases
   - Authentication flow issues

3. **Performance Concerns**
   - Image loading and processing times
   - API response times for AI generation
   - Client-side rendering performance

## Next Development Priorities

Based on the current status, the following priorities are recommended:

1. **Complete Printful API v2 Integration**
   - Update the demo page to properly display product information
   - Add error handling and retry logic for API calls
   - Implement the remaining API endpoints (order creation, etc.)
   - Add unit tests for the API service and middleware

2. **Integrate Printful API with T-Shirt Customization**
   - Connect the Printful API to the t-shirt customization UI
   - Implement color and size selection based on available variants
   - Create realistic mockup generation using the Printful API

3. **Complete Core AI Design Flow**
   - Ensure reliable design generation from prompts
   - Implement design customization options
   - Create seamless user experience for design creation

4. **Implement E-commerce Functionality**
   - Complete cart and checkout flow
   - Integrate with Printful for fulfillment
   - Set up payment processing with Stripe

5. **User Account Management**
   - Finalize authentication flows
   - Implement user profiles and saved designs
   - Create order history and tracking
