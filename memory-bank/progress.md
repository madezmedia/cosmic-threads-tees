âœ… API route structure  
âœ… Tailwind CSS configuration  

## What Works

Based on the current file structure, the following features appear to be implemented or in progress:

### Core Infrastructure

âœ… Next.js application framework  
âœ… TypeScript integration  
âœ… Tailwind CSS styling  
âœ… shadcn/ui component library  
âœ… Basic routing structure  

### User Interface Components

âœ… Basic UI components from shadcn/ui  
âœ… Custom components for specific functionality:
  - Design generator components
  - T-shirt selector
  - Style selector
  - Prompt enhancer
  - Various visual elements (retro grid, orbit, etc.)

### Pages

âœ… Home page  
âœ… Create design page  
âœ… Gallery page  
âœ… Dashboard page  
âœ… Authentication pages (login, register)  
âœ… Checkout flow pages  
âœ… Informational pages (about, how it works, etc.)  

### API Routes

âœ… Authentication API routes  
âœ… Design-related API routes  
âœ… Prompt enhancement API  
âœ… Image generation API routes  

### Services

âœ… Basic service structure for:

Potential areas to monitor for issues:

1. **AI Generation Quality**
   - Consistency of generated designs
   - Handling of complex or ambiguous prompts
   - Generation speed and reliability

2. **Integration Challenges**
   - Printful API limitations or rate limits
   - Payment processing edge cases
   - Authentication flow issues

3. **Performance Concerns**
   - Image loading and processing times
   - API response times for AI generation
   - Client-side rendering performance

## Next Development Priorities

Based on the current status, the following priorities are recommended:

1. **Complete Core AI Design Flow**
   - Ensure reliable design generation from prompts
   - Implement design customization options
   - Create seamless user experience for design creation

2. **Finalize Product Customization**
   - Complete t-shirt preview functionality
