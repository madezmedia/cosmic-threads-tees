- ✅ Improved design preview component

## In Progress

### Wall Art Generation
- 🔄 Implement upscaling service for high-resolution prints
- 🔄 Add more wall art styles beyond minimalist, abstract, and landscape
- 🔄 Create wall art mockup visualization component

### User Experience
- ✅ Streamline design creation workflow
- 🔄 Enhance mobile experience for design customization
- 🔄 Implement AR visualization for mobile users
- 🔄 Fix font loading issues (retrofuture.woff2)

### API Integration
- 🔄 Connect redesigned UI with real API endpoints
- 🔄 Implement proper error handling for API failures
- 🔄 Add loading states and progress indicators

## Planned Features

### Enhanced AI Generation
- 📝 Multi-variant design generation
- 📝 Design history with version tracking
- 📝 Style transfer between designs

### Product Expansion
- 📝 Add more wall art formats (metal prints, tapestries)
- 📝 Expand apparel beyond t-shirts (hoodies, hats)
- 📝 Multi-placement designs (front/back/sleeve)

### Community Features
- 📝 Public user galleries
- 📝 Design challenges and contests
- 📝 Social sharing integration

## Known Issues
- ⚠️ High-resolution generation sometimes times out
- ⚠️ Mobile design customization needs optimization
- ⚠️ Need to implement proper error handling in wall art service
- ⚠️ Font loading issues with retrofuture.woff2
- ⚠️ Mock data used in UI instead of real API integration
- ✅ Fixed: Duplicated design pages with incorrect component usage

## Next Immediate Tasks
1. Fix font loading issues
2. Connect redesigned UI with real API endpoints
3. Implement proper error handling for API failures
4. Add animation effects for transitions between steps
5. Optimize mobile design experience
